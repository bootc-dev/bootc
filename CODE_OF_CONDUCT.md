# Bootc Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

The Bootc project community is dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Code of Conduct

The Bootc project has adopted the [CNCF Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

All community members, contributors, and participants in the Bootc project are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct. This includes respectful treatment of everyone regardless of their background or identity.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all Bootc project spaces, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories under the [bootc-dev organization](https://github.com/bootc-dev)
- Issue trackers and pull requests
- Community meetings and events (including CNCF meetings - https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/bootc)
- CNCF Slack #bootc-dev channel (https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C08SKSQKG1L)
- Discussion forums and mailing lists
- Any other forums created by the project team that the community uses for communication

The Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the Bootc project in public spaces. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the Bootc maintainers:

- **Maintainers**: Contact any of the [project maintainers](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)
- **CNCF Slack**: Send a message to one of the maintainers on the channel [#bootc-dev channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C08SKSQKG1L)
- **Discussions**: Create a topic in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/discussions)

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

### Enforcement Process

The Bootc project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

As outlined in the [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md):

> Code of Conduct violations by community members will be discussed and resolved by the maintainers privately. If a Maintainer is directly involved in the report, the Maintainers will instead designate two Maintainers to work with the CNCF Code of Conduct Committee in resolving it.

The maintainers have the right and responsibility to:
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct
- Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

### Escalation to CNCF

For incidents involving project maintainers or if you are not satisfied with how maintainers have handled a report, you may escalate to the CNCF Code of Conduct Committee:

- **Email**: conduct@cncf.io
- **Process**: See the [CNCF Incident Resolution Procedures](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
