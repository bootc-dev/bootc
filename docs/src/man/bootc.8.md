# NAME

bootc - Deploy and transactionally in-place with bootable container
images

# SYNOPSIS

**bootc** \[*OPTIONS...*\] <*SUBCOMMAND*>

# DESCRIPTION

Deploy and transactionally in-place with bootable container images.

The `bootc` project currently uses ostree-containers as a backend to
support a model of bootable container images. Once installed, whether
directly via `bootc install` (executed as part of a container) or via
another mechanism such as an OS installer tool, further updates can be
pulled and `bootc upgrade`.
