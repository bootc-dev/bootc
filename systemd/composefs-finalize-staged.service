# This is a quite long timeout intentionally; the failure mode
# here is that people don't get an upgrade.  We need to handle
# cases with slow rotational media, etc.
TimeoutStopSec=5m
# Bootc should never touch /var at all...except, we need to remove
# the /var/.updated flag, so we can't just `InaccessiblePaths=/var` right now.
# For now, let's at least use ProtectHome just so we have some sandboxing
# of that.
ProtectHome=yes
# And we shouldn't affect the current deployment's /etc.
ReadOnlyPaths=/etc
# We write to /sysroot and /boot of course.
