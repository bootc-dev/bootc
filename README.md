# bootc

Transactional, in-place operating system updates using OCI/Docker container images.

## Motivation

The original Docker container model of using "layers" to model
applications has been extremely successful.  This project
aims to apply the same technique for bootable host systems - using
standard OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery format
for base operating system updates.

The container image includes a Linux kernel (in e.g. `/usr/lib/modules`),
which is used to boot.  At runtime on a target system, the base userspace is
*not* itself running in a "container" by default. For example, assuming
systemd is in use, systemd acts as pid1 as usual - there's no "outer" process.
More about this in the docs; see below.

## Status

The CLI and API are considered stable. We will ensure that every existing system
can be upgraded in place seamlessly across any future changes.

## Documentation

See the [project documentation](https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/).

## Versioning

Although bootc is not released to crates.io as a library, version
numbers are expected to follow [semantic
versioning](https://semver.org/) standards.  This practice began with
the release of version 1.2.0; versions prior may not adhere strictly
to semver standards.

## Adopters (base and end-user images)

The bootc CLI is just a client system; it is not tied to any particular
operating system or Linux distribution. You very likely want to actually
start by looking at [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md).

## Community discussion

- [Github discussion forum](https://github.com/containers/bootc/discussions) for async discussion
- [#bootc-dev on CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C08SKSQKG1L) for live chat
- Recurring live meeting hosted on [CNCF Zoom](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/96540875093?password=7889708d-c520-4565-90d3-ce9e253a1f65) each Friday at 15:30 UTC.

This project is also tightly related to the previously mentioned Fedora/CentOS bootc project,
and many developers monitor the relevant discussion forums there. In particular there's a
Matrix channel and a weekly video call meeting for example: <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/community/>.
